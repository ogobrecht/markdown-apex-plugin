# Headers Are Starting With 1-6 `#` Hash Characters

## The Number Of Hash Characters

### Defining The Header Level 

Text wrapped into `*` asterisks or `_` underscores is emphasized. One of these characters results in `*italic*` *italic* font style, two in `**bold**` **bold** font style. Both styles can be `***combined***` ***combined***.

New paragraphs  
begin with a blank line. You can make line breaks by placing two or more spaces at the end of a line like in this sentence after the words "New paragraphs". With enabled Markdown Extra syntax you do not need the two spaces - each line break is converted into an `<br>` element. 

* An unordered list begins with one of the following signs: `* - +`
* Hard wraps are ignored in lists for better readability except you are enabling newlines Ã  la GitHub (Markdown Extra enhancement, see below...)
    * Sublist entries start by adding four spaces
* Ordered lists begin with a number
    1. The number value is not interesting for the rendered result
    1. Can you see the point?

You can write `inline code` by wrapping the text in `` `back ticks` `` ... 

    ... or complete code blocks by adding four spaces in front of your text.

> Blockquotes start with `>`
>> Blockquotes can be nested by adding additional `>`

Horizontal rules beginn with three or more `---` minus signs.

Links are wrapped in square brackets. There are two types of links: inline and reference.

Inline example:  
`[example](http://example.com/ "Optional title")`

Reference example:  
`[Markdown basics][1]`

You then put the link target anywhere in your text:  
`[1]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics`

The rendered result: [Markdown basics][1]

Images can be created in the same way like links - the only difference is the exclamation mark at the beginning:  
`![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")`

Since version 1.1.0 the plugin supports the well known image substitution strings (also in lowercase) and brings a configurable one for a custom image function. Here the possible substitutions and the current paths of this system:

&#35;images&#35;
:   #images#

&#35;image_prefix&#35;
:   #image_prefix#

&#35;app_images&#35;
:   #app_images#

&#35;workspace_images&#35;
:   #workspace_images#

We try now to reference an image from this webserver with the &#35;image_prefix&#35;:
